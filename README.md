# COVID Insights Project
This is a term project for my STAT292 class at METU. In this project we have visualized covid data in a map, created linear model tab that people can select different variables to see their effect and also time series analysis part which you can look at the screenshots below.

## Disclaimer
To make this work you need to download the covid dataset from <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data">this link</a> as a csv file and put that in the same folder named "owid-covid-data.csv".
